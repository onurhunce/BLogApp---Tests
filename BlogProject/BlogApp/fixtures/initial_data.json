It features a new 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with an ISO range of 100-12800 (expandable to ISO 25600), as well as 5fps continuous shooting.\r\n\r\nCanon has also implemented its DIGIC 6 image processor which supersedes the DIGIC 5 unit found in the 700D, and the new model also receives an upgraded 19-point autofocus system pulled from the EOS 70D. The 750D\u2019s exposure metering system is new, too, as is the inclusion of Wi-Fi connectivity with NFC pairing.\r\n\r\nExternally the 750D is almost identical to its predecessor, featuring a 3-inch 1040k-dot LCD display that\u2019s both touch-sensitive and able to articulate. The camera\u2019s physical control layout is also very similar to the 700D. However, if you like the look of the top-panel LCD display and rear control wheel on the EOS 70D, the new 760D introduced alongside the 750D includes these features, but in every other respect is identical to the 750D.\r\n\r\nExpect to pay around \u00a3600/$750 for a 750D body, or \u00a3690/$850 for an 18-55mm lens kit.\r\n",

It was not cool to like Turkish music then, and I was part of a generation that took pride in not listening to any of it. \r\n\r\nBut when I moved to New York and started doing music photography at the beginning of 2000s, some of the musicians I met were thrilled to hear I was from Turkey and they kept asking me about artists I barely knew. At first, I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but then I started feeling embarrassed, because everyone seemed to be more familiar with these Turkish musicians than I was.

After years of sporadic reading, digesting so many books this year has nourished my long book-starved soul.\r\n\r\nAnd, with the summer travel season in full swing, I wanted to share my recent favorite reads.

I\u2019m glad I finally read it \u2014 it was incredible. An autobiographical novel following the author Peter Mayle\u2019s year living in Provence, it details the struggles and joys of adapting to a new culture. I loved the interesting characters he meets and his description of the slow pace of life in France (which was a clear departure from his previous life in England). As a Francophile, this book makes me want to move to France even more. Wonderfully and wistfully written, I can understand why it continues to be such a classic.",

After a strong 2014, highlights of which were winning Queen\u2019s and reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals, his form levelled off somewhat and he feels he needs change.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrigor Dimitrov parts with coach Roger Rasheed after run of bad form\r\n Read more\r\nCoach-player separations are hardly rare in professional tennis; players go through them like hot dinners, and on occasions it can seem like a desperate reaction that might not be necessary or profitable.\r\n\r\nDimitrov is 24, and judging from his interview following his third-round loss to Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon he clearly feels he must not sit about consoling himself with the fact that he still has time on his side. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself that young any more,\u201d said the Bulgarian.\r\n\r\nThis is a mature mindset to have, and Dimitrov is sensible to stay receptive to variations and advancements which might bring about his development, but you sometimes feel tennis players are lured into firing coaches when encumbered by a run of poor form.\r\n\r\nBad form is not clever. Neither is losing, and I know \u2013 I\u2019ve done it often enough in my professional career. The first impulse is to take it out on the coach, girlfriend, pet \u2013 whoever is nearest. I\u2019m extremely good at making it someone else\u2019s fault and that can be enormously cathartic.\r\n\r\nIn between games in squash matches (where, unlike at Wimbledon, you can confer with your coach) I\u2019ve regularly had the obligatory tantrum, gazed furiously into the eyes of the coach, beleaguered by oxygen debt and overrun by adrenaline, willing him to gift me the answers. But in the end I have to work it out. I am the player. He or she, as coach, can help, but in the end only the person on the court can produce the complex network of decisions and actions that the player needs to win points and matches.\r\n",

The 39-year-old is due some major luck. Stenson tied third at St Andrews in 2010. A major success seems inevitable before too long, with his right to left shot shape an advantage here. He also looks to have the better side of the draw.\r\n\r\nMartin Kaymer (Ger)\r\nHighest Open finish 7th 2010\r\n\r\nThe German\u2019s focus all year has been on this event, which is significant. When properly focused, Kaymer, 30, is hard to beat. He has tasted success before at St Andrews, when claiming the Dunhill Links Championship in 2007. One worry is how Kaymer\u2019s high ball-flight may handle the wind. But he is adaptable and showed a timely return to form at his last event, the French Open.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Open 2015: players' guide to the key holes at St Andrews\r\n Read more\r\nPaul Casey (GB)\r\nHighest Open finish 3rd 2010\r\n\r\nBecause of injury and the loss of form triggered by the same, people tend to forget just how talented Casey is. He didn\u2019t reach No3 in the world rankings and claim 13 European Tour victories without serious ability. Casey\u2019s St Andrews record is good. The 37-year-old is desperate to announce his obvious return to form; there would be no better platform.\r\n\r\nAdam Scott (Aus)\r\n\r\nHighest Open finish 2nd 2012\r\n\r\nHas been strangely under the radar recently, a curious scenario for one of the best golfers in the world. Scott has Steve Williams back as caddie, which appeared to kick-start his form at the US Open. The value of Williams to Scott shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. Scott, 34, is the Open\u2019s Mr Consistent. He has finished no worse than fifth in his past three starts and should have won in 2012.",

    "body": "Does the name Rolando Bianchi ring any bells? Even distant ones? In all honesty the help of a search engine was required to jog this old brain about the kind of summer purchase that dominated the thoughts of Manchester City\u2019s movers and shakers prior to the Abu Dhabi United Group takeover.\r\n\r\nRewind to 2007, the age of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Thaksin Shinawatra and a curious and half-baked first attempt at an internationally owned City revamp. The club blew about \u00a340m on a range of players that summer, the most expensive of whom was Bianchi, a 6ft 2in striker who joined from Reggina for \u00a38.8m. He scored on his debut as it happened but optimism soon fizzled out. By January he was so unsettled he was allowed to leave and he returned to Italy to pick up a modest career.\r\n\r\nRecalling the tale of Bianchi brings context as City part with \u00a349m to welcome their prime summer target, Raheem Sterling. The fact that their bartering with Liverpool scaled such expensive peaks reflects how remarkably difficult it is for any club \u2013 even one with huge financial backing \u2013 to recruit what could be defined as A-list talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaheem Sterling relieved with \u00a349m Manchester City move from Liverpool\r\n Read more\r\nSterling may turn out to be worth every single one of the many pennies required for Liverpool to release the 20-year-old, and, equally, supposedly surer things than he have turned out to be very costly failed experiments. But it does feel as if part of the package was that City required a signing with wow factor this summer \u2013 something to turn heads, create new energy, attract a spotlight.",

    "body": "The frenzied two-week maelstrom that is NBA free agency has come to an end, save for the last few stragglers and fringe rotation players. Surprisingly enough, the biggest domino of all was one of the last to fall. It lacked the overwrought fanfare of The Decision or even a ghostwritten open letter in Sports Illustrated, but on Thursday, LeBron James finally returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers on a two-year, $47m contract.\r\n\r\nThe delay in question wasn\u2019t an indication that he ever planned to leave Cleveland. Rather, it speaks to the fact that James is the one free agent who has enough agency to actually be considered \u201cfree\u201d\r\n\r\nAs was the case last summer, James has the option to once again opt out in 2016 just as the NBA salary cap jumps from $70m to $90m. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he wants to keep the good times rolling with one-and-one contracts, James could then opt to once again hit the market in 2017 when the cap\u2019s expected to hit an unprecedented $108m, which would push James\u2019 \u201817-\u201918 max salary up to a whopping $35.5m,\u201d Dan Devine wrote at Yahoo! Sports. \u201cThat would be the highest single-season player salary in NBA history, topping Michael Jordan\u2019s $33m deal to play for the Chicago Bulls during the 1997-98 season. And so on, and so on.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t just about James being compensated at a rate that begins to approach his on-court contributions. He\u2019s dead set on getting the whole Eastern Conference title-winning band back together.\r\n\r\nIn the days prior to his signing, ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst reported that James was stalling to nudge the Cavs to sign Tristan Thompson to a long-term deal. James seems equally invested in reenlisting mercurial shooting guard JR Smith and sparkplug Matthew Dellavedova. That\u2019s after commandeering a cabana to whisper a few sweet nothings in Kevin Love\u2019s ear, and you can only assume that he had a hand in bringing back Mo Williams, a teammate from James\u2019 previous stint in Cleveland.\r\n",

    "body": "Why have Manchester United bought Morgan Schneiderlin?\r\nThere have been glaring gaps in Manchester United\u2019s midfield resources for a few seasons. Last summer\u2019s addition of Daley Blind and Ander Herrera bolstered Louis van Gaal\u2019s options but neither of these players can dominate a contest. This is what the club continue to require and this is what fascinates about the acquisition of Schneiderlin. Lynchpin, maestro, gun midfielder: whatever the sobriquet, can the Frenchman really grab a high-end Premier League match or thrive in the crucible of the Champions League? Bastian Schweinsteiger\u2019s purchase means the club have a been-there-done-that-won-the-World Cup elite schemer but the German is more in the Michael Carrick mould. Perhaps Schneiderlin has not been bought for this lead role. If not then he may simply be an upgrade on Blind or a younger Carrick. It would follow, then, that Van Gaal continues the quest for a central operator who can be the man. This is now Schneiderlin\u2019s moment to prove he can be. Jamie Jackson\r\n\r\nBastian Schweinsteiger\u2019s exit robs Munich of a Bavarian football god\r\nRaphael Honigstein\r\n Read more\r\nWhat can United expect from Schneiderlin?\r\nRonald Koeman was asked exactly that as he conducted his pre-Austria training camp press duties at Staplewood.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverybody knows the qualities of the player and, if they are looking at the position where he plays with us, then that\u2019s the best for him,\u201d Southampton\u2019s manager said. \u201cHe is still a young player, an international player already, and he can develop himself even more than he did over the last few years at Southampton.\u201d",
